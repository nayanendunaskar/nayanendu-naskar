    HELLO FOLKS!!! Myself Nayanendu Naskar

    I'm learning JavaScript.

    I've worked on some CLI apps.

    I love to sing, play guitar and I love adventure.

    I had interest in software development from school time,
    but never got that opportunity. Now I'll make this as my carrer.
    Thank you for reading.
